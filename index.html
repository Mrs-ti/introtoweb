                    <p>
                        <span>Hello</span> I am currently a senior at 
                            Kennesaw State University. It's been a long year but well serverd. 
                            I will soon be obtaining my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Cybersecurity in 
                            May. In addition to my major, I will have a minor in Information Technology. 
                            I also have an Associate Degree in applied science. I started of my bachelor's
                             degree journey in Nursing at Georgia State University. I took a few medical
                              courses which I thoroughly enjoyed. As life changes happen to us all, 
                              I decided to take a break to focus on myself and my next steps before 
                              I had an epiphany that I needed to get back into school and do something
                               with computers. Well, fast forward to today, and several semesters later,
                                here I am at the finish line! 
                        A little bit about me, I come from a family of six, me being the youngest
                         girl out of the bunch. I am originally from New Jersey. A few years ago, 
                         after obtaining my first degree, I decided I wanted a change of environment 
                         and some new scenery. That is when I decided to pack up and move to Atlanta.
                          This was one of the best decisions I could make for my journey. Atlanta 
                          has exposed me to so much and afforded me many great opportunities. 
                         Regarding my professional background, I come from the world of Fraud and Finance.
                         I started banking right after graduating high school. When I moved to Atlanta 
                         I decided to keep my career path in banking, and I also decided to go into retail.
                          While managing the two jobs, I realized I was ready to get back into school.
                           During my banking career, I was given the opportunity to move into Corporate 
                           and transition into the Fraud Detection field. I have over 10+ years of fraud 
                           experience. I currently still hold a career in this field. In May, I will
                            be transitioning into Cybersecurity for my new career path. I aim to try a
                             little of everything in the cyber field and see what I am truly passionate
                              about most. I do not want to limit myself. Therefore, I want to see the ins 
                              and outs of every part of this world to see what I fall in love with most.
                               Once I get that under my belt, my goal is to open my own consulting business 
                               within the cybersecurity field to help organizations stay protected.
